        Is a networking and communication project in the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum. Its main objective is to create a simple client-server communication system using the UNIX signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. Here's an overview of how the project typically works:
        </P>
        <P>1 - Client-Server Architecture: The project involves two programs: a client and a server. The client sends a message to the server, and the server receives and displays the message.</P>
        <P>2 - Signal Handling: The communication between the client and server is achieved using signals. Specifically, the client sends the message character by character to the server using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.</P>
        <P>3 - Message Encoding: Each character of the message is encoded into a binary representation before being sent to the server. For example, 'A' might be represented as 01000001 in binary.</P>
        <P>4 - Signal Transmission: The client sends the binary representation of each character to the server using a series of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals. For instance, sending a '0' bit could be done using SIGUSR1, and sending a '1' bit could be done using SIGUSR2.</P>
        <P>5 - Server Reception: The server receives the binary data sent by the client, decodes it back into characters, and displays the original message.</P>
